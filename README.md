@See [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli) for further information.

### Authorization

If you're not currently logged in to GitHub, you'll be prompted to use the /login slash command. Enter this command and follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate.

### Authenticate with a Personal Access Token (PAT)

You can also authenticate using a fine-grained PAT with the "Copilot Requests" permission enabled.

1. Visit <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>
1. Under "Permissions," click "add permissions" and select "Copilot Requests"
1. Generate your token
1. Add the token to your environment via the environment variable `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` (in order of precedence).
  For example:

    ```ini
    # .ddev/.env
    GH_TOKEN=super-secret-github-pat
    ```

> [!CAUTION]
> `.ddev/.env` and your PAT are considered sensitive information. Do *NOT* commit these values to your repository.
